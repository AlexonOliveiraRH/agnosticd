= Packer common images

== Build to your account
Create and copy the image to multiple regions:

[source,bash]
----
packer build -var-file=${HOME}/secrets/gpte.json rhel_gold.json
----

== Use the image

When deploying a config:

. Make sure either:
  * the config is using the common CloudFormation template
  * the CF template in the config directory supports the variable `custom_image`
. Run the playbook with `-e custom_image_filter=IMAGENAME`. For example:

  -e "custom_image_filter=RHEL 7.5 GOLD packer 1542702393"


If the image is found, then it will be used, otherwise, playbook defaults to what is defined in the CloudFormation template.
